Incubating features
===================

This section is dedicated to new features that are under development, looking for user testing and feedback. They are
generally behind a flag to enable them to explicitly opt-in on this testing stage. They require the very latest Conan
version (sometimes recommended running from the ``develop2`` source branch), and explicitly setting those flags.
